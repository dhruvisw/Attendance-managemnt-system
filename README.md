# Attendance-management-system

The Attendance Management System is intended to replace the manual model of attendance record keeping by means of roll call and paper records. The roll call and paper records are replaced with a single interaction between the professor and the Attendance Management System. Professors will be able to view details regarding attendance of individual students on their  PC and quickly maintain attendance records. The features expressed in this Software Requirements Specification document are intended to be fully implemented in this version. We aim at an iterative development model to build our system. Iterative development model starts with full system, then changes functionalities of each subsystem with each new release. We have created our product development model by combining this feature of the Scrum model with the iterative model.
